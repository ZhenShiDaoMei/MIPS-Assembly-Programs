# MIPS-Assembly-Programs
Various MIPS Assembly programs that I wrote. These files contain functions that perform different tasks and are expected to be called in a seperate file (sometimes in specific formats as well)  

## Block Cipher  
Encrypt and decrypt messages using a block cipher (Using the RSA algorithm).  

## Network Data Structure  
Constructs a network(graph) with nodes and edges. the network models people and their relationships with each other. Within the network we can check to see if people are distant friends, and get a person through query network.  

## Rotate Matrices  
Manipulate 2D arrays to rotate matrices formatted in text files (90deg, 180deg, 270deg). Create mirrors of arrays, and check arrays for any duplicate rows.  

## Utilities  
Validate arguments, converts strings to integers, decode I-Type instructions, convert hexadecimal string to 32-bit floating point number in IEE 754 format, and verify a hand in a custom card game.
